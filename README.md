# minesweeper
Personal project. Minesweeper using python. Incomplete.

Minesweeper clone. Press the squares on the grid to reveal numbers. Numbers in a square indicates the number of mines adjacent / diagonal to set square. Press the button on the top right to turn on the mode to place flags. Flags are used to indicate where mines are, and cannot be pressed until pressing the button again and selecting the square to unflag. Blue squares indicate dug up areas. Green squares indicate flags. White squares indicate untouched areas. Red squares indicate all mines, and will be revealed at the end of the game when a mine is dug up.

Largely incomplete. A few bugs regarding the start of the game and detecting "outlines" of numbers. It should not be possible to place a mine in an already dug up square. No lose or win screen. Overall incomplete feel.

To Play, download the minesweeper folder. Run minesweeper.py using IDLE (or any of choice).
