# minesweeper
Personal project. Minesweeper using python. Incomplete.

Minesweeper clone. Press the squares on the grid to reveal numbers. Numbers in a square indicates the number of mines adjacent / diagonal to set square. Press the button on the top right to turn on the mode to place flags. Flags are used to indicate where mines are, and cannot be pressed until pressing the button again and selecting the square to unflag.

Largely incomplete. A few bugs regarding the start of the game and detecting "outlines" of numbers. No lose or win screen. Overall incomplete feel.

To Play, download the minesweeper folder. Run minesweeper.py using IDLE (or any of choice).
